**Project Submitted to Hack This Fall 2.0**
## Inspiration
Diversity and inclusion has great goals to achieve. While we are progressing fast enough to reach to it but a major chunk of the stories and experiences remain unheard. People often feel scared or too shy to talk about it with their closed ones in the feeling of getting judged, while some of us faced and proudly overcome the fear. This gave me an inspiration to find a solution that can somehow address the problem. In an attempt to solve the problem, I have created a platform that can unite the people who fought the battle successfully and people who are fighting it now. Anyone can share their story, whether happy or sad, joyful or painful, we are here to celebrate your success and help you fight the battle. **We stand together**
## What it does
**Stories** allows an individual to create _memory-cards_ where they can talk about their experience of diversity and inclusion. After a successful login/signin, all you need to do is share your message to the world, add relevant tags to make other people find it easily, and a suitable picture, if any. You can also edit the story if you want. Other users can react to your post, add comments to show their support and even share one story similarly
## How we built it
- The frontend was entirely build on react and redux with the help of various packages.
- The database used for the project is mongoDB atlas.
- For authorization, we gave two option: Google OAuth using the OAuth 2.0 API and JWT Auth.
- The JWT AUTH was built using react for frontend and express for API calls and backend.
- Finally, the backend was hosted using Heroku CLI while hosting the frontend on Netlify.
## Challenges we ran into
- Building an entire full-stack application was a great challenge in itself!
- Since we used JWT for the first time, we took quite an amount of time solving the bugs.
- We wrote API's for the first time to allow calls to the backend from frontend, spent a good amount of time reading and implementing it.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Building a full stack application within a given time-frame
- Implementing JWT authentication successfully for the first time.
- Wrote API calls for the backend successfully.
- Implementing several CRUD applications like create post, delete it, like, comment, edit, etc.
- Successfully deploying the frontend and connecting it with a cloud database.
- Changing the state of the application based on user signin or signout.
## What we learned
- Used JWT authentication for the first time. Understood the frontend, middleware and the backend.
- Had a great time working with API's - building your own and using the external one's
- Successfully connected the frontend with a database and hosted both of them live.
## What's next for Stories-We Stand Together
- This is the initial prototype of the idea. Would love to find ways to improve its lighthouse performance, work on improving the UI/UX experience.
- Help this platform reach a wider audience and include more stories for the world.
- Improve the authentication connectivity.
- Add more CRUD features to make it more interactive and user-friendly.
